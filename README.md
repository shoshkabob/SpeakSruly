# SpeakSruly

Designed by the incredible Chava Weisberg and put together in mostly Ruby by Shoshanah Weisinger

Sruly Heller is a man of much eloquence. Often, we can't understand his Facebook statuses. This is a hilarious creation of ours that attempts to solve this problem, but inevitably doesn't completely because machine translation is *complicated*.

SpeakSruly uses a Sinatra server and the [Wordnik Ruby Gem](https://github.com/wordnik/wordnik-ruby) to filter out the most basic words and serve up a translation of the ones that are a little more advanced. What ensues is a hilarious overtranslation!
